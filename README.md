This has been inpired by this tweet (https://twitter.com/AllenDowney/status/1063460117029535746) and this detailed answer (https://towardsdatascience.com/estimating-probabilities-with-bayesian-modeling-in-python-7144be007815). My goal is to train myself by reproducing the logic using different variables.


Bears and moose sightings in Grand Tetons

I visited Grand Tetons with my wife and kids in August 2017. We spent a couple of days there and were luckiy enough to spot 3 moose and 1 female grizzly bear with 2 cubs. Assuming a moose is 2 times more likely to be seen than a female grizzly bear and that a grizzly cub is two times less likely to be seen than a female grizzly bear, estimate the prevalence of each type of animal (moose, female grizzly bear, grizzly cub).
